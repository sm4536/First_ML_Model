We have observed that there is strong positive correlation between \"smoker\" and \"charges\" attribute and no correlation between 'region' and 'charges' attributes. Positive correlation implies, the attributes are dependent on each other and no correlation would imply that the change on 'region' attribute will not be effecting the 'charges' attribute.
